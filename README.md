# Johnny Builds

This is the website for [johnnybuilds.com](https://johnnybuilds.com) where I build web stuff for people in public. It is pretty much a [basic next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs) with a contact form, animated social link dock, subtle glitch text effects and more. You can read about how I built it at [How Johnny Builds New Web Projects](https://medium.com/@johnnybuilds/how-johnny-builds-new-web-projects-51f32b39bc20) and [How Johnny Built JohnnyBuilds.com](https://medium.com/@johnnybuilds/how-johnny-built-johnnybuilds-com-7cbea268e8fe).
